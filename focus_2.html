		<h1 class="mt-4">Focus Question 2</h1>
		<h5 class="mt-4">Is it ever worth it to manage your own private cloud services?</h5>

		<div class="mt-4">
			<p>The choice for private cloud which we have decided on is Owncloud. Owncloud is an open source private cloud provider which means that their code for the platform is visible to everyone. This makes it easy for programmers around the world to see that code and pinpoint any bugs which the engineers of Owncloud can then fix accordingly. Owncloud has a strong focus on security  and data privacy. Most of the big cloud service providers like Google drive, Dropbox, etc are hosted in the United States and there do not exist strong privacy laws which protect the data of the user.</p>

			<p>In contrast to most cloud providers — who aggregate data from different customers to minimize storage needs — Owncloud is single tenant based and provides separate cloud instances with dedicated private storage for each customer. An Owncloud instance is a dedicated installation with dedicated storage and user space. It is only accessible by the user. Other Owncloud users have their own dedicated workspace so no cross-cloud access is possible.</p>
			
			<p>Owncloud is hosted on a german server and Germany has the most strict data security and privacy law. In Germany data providers are bounded by the GDPR and German Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG) which governs the exposure of the personal data, which are manually processed or stored in the IT systems.</p>

			<p>In addition to that, it has end-end encryption which provides higher security. Own cloud uses 2048 RSA / 256 Bit AES End-to-End-Encryption which increases the security standard for file sharing and storage so it is almost impossible for hackers to break into this system. This encryption standard is higher than what is offered by the common public cloud providers. Not even third parties nor own cloud administrators can have access to the data due to this encryption. Since the data stored inside the private cloud is behind a firewall it is more secure so for the companies which have sensitive data Owncloud could be a better choice. In addition to this, own cloud has a custom password policy.</p>

			<p>In conclusion, the choice between public cloud and private cloud mainly depends on the needs of the organization. If it is a small company which still has time to grow then using a public cloud would be the more cost-effective and flexible option whereas for large organizations who value privacy and data integrity the hassles of private cloud seem to be justified. </p>
