		<h2>Setting Up Virtual Private Server</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">virtual private server</a> is a virtual machine sold by an Internet hosting service. It is like a remote computer that runs its own copy of operating system that runs based on 24/7 service. There are many host services across the globe such as <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/">Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines</a>, or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud">IBM Cloud</a>. Here, DigitalOcean is used as the VPS for hosting a private cloud for demonstration.</p>

		<h3 class="mt-5"># Creating A Project in DigitalOcean</h3>
		A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/projects/">Project</a> is a space that allows user to manage different virtual resources. Create a project space for a virtual private cloud.

		<h3 class="mt-5"># Creating A Droplet</h3>
		A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/">Droplet</a> is a Linux-based virtual machines that run according to a cloud-based infrastructure. Create a droplet to host a Linux server.

		<h3 class="mt-5"># Selecting an OS Distribution</h3>
		This is to install a copy of an operating system onto the virtual machine. There are various <a href="https://crouchtech.io/top-linux-distributions-for-cloud-computing">Linux OS Distributions</a> that are usable for cloud computing. Here, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> server is selected as part of the demonstration.

		<h3 class="mt-5"># Selecting a Droplet Plan</h3>
		<p>Selecting the droplet plan depends on your needs on private cloud. Large organizations that continuously store large amount of data have a higher tendency to go after a dedicated CPU because it is more stable, as the resources are not shared across multiple users.</p><p>On the other hand, smaller organizations would prefer a shared CPU because the needs are not huge. Therefore, choosing the droplet plan would depend on how much data will be stored on the private cloud. </p>For general purposes, it is recommended to go after the standard version. The difference between a shared CPU and a dedicated CPU can be found under the article <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/resources/choose-plan/">DigitalOcean Choosing A Plan</a>.

		<h3 class="mt-5"># Choosing A Datacenter Region</h3>
		<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center">datacenter</a> is a centralized location where computing and networking equipments are concentrated for the purpose of managing large amount of data. It can be considered as a center with huge amount of computers. Data centers are typically built throughout the world to provide a scalable and efficient service to people across the world.</p> <a href="https://virtusdatacentres.com/item/344-does-it-matter-where-my-data-centre-is-physically-located">Choosing the right datacenter</a> will effectively boost data speeds and latency transfers. It is recommended to pick a data center that is closest to your region. (Singapore is closest to us)

		<h3 class="mt-5" id="authentication"># Choosing Droplet Authentication Method</h3>
		<p>This is to verify the identity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen">SSH or Secure Shell</a> is a network protocol, or a method of communicating between two machines remotely with a strong encryption algorithm, allowing one person to gain control of the servers via the internet.</p> SSH approach creates <a href="https://blog.runcloud.io/2018/11/28/why-authentication-using-ssh-public-key-is-better-than-using-password-and-how-do-they-work.html"> better security than passwords</a> due to the encryption approach used, but usage ultimately boils down to the user's needs. For demostration purposes, we will be using the one-time password approach.

		<h3 class="mt-5"># Enabling A System-level Backup (Optional)</h3>
		An optional choice of backing up the server weekly where the backup data is stored for a period of at most one month. For more information, refer to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/backups/overview/">DigitalOcean Backup Overview</a>.

		<h3 class="mt-5"># Finalizing Droplet Creation</h3>
		Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, the virtual server is now successfully created with the IP address as your server's IP address. For more information on how these IP addresses work with servers, refer to <a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/web-server5.htm">How Web Servers Work</a>.
