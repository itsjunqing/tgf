		<h1 class="mt-4">Focus Question 3</h1>
		<h5 class="mt-4">Do you have the moral standing to complain about encroachment on your privacy when you consciously give away your information to third party services?</h5>

		<div class="mt-4">
			<p class="font-italic">What does it mean to have your agreement in the terms and conditions when using a website?</p>

			<p>Most websites have their own terms and conditions where the user is agrees to it without reading the fine print. It gives the website the right to retain customer information in their database but also more importantly it gives them the right to track usage through cookies in the web browser. Users give web-based services – and third parties the services contract with, about which users know nothing – the right to keep, analyse and sell their data. Increasingly often, too, people click away their right to go to court if anything goes wrong.</p>

			<p>When clicking on ‘I agree’ the users acknowledge that they cannot sue the company in the case when the third party misuses their data. This includes the data input by the user like name, gender, phone number, address, etc. This is the data given voluntarily by the user and the user expects that it will not be misused. Hence, the rights of a person over its privacy is closely related to the terms and conditions which the person accepts.</p>

			<p>Here is a couple of privacy breach events:</p>

			<p>In 2015, AT&T, a major telecom provider was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/08/att-data-breaches-revealed-280k-us-customers-exposed.html">fined for USD$25 million</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission">FCC (Federal Communications Commision)</a> for data security and privacy violation. Employees at AT&T call centres in Mexico, Colombia and the Philippines were found to have stolen the names and full or partial Social Security numbers of about 280,000 of the wireless carrier’s customers in the United States. The workers sold that information to third parties. This whole practice was done so that these phones could be unlocked and used freely bypassing the contract with AT&T. </p>

			<p>The penalty imposed by FCC was the largest ever in history for privacy violation. No hack occurred but rather was an insider threat-based data misuse which caused concerns amongst AT&T users as to how their sensitive data like social security number was being sold to people whom they did not give consent to. AT&T terminated the contract with that call centre after the fine and pledged to take user’s data more seriously. Hence, it shows that a breach in contract is not to foreign in our current society.</p>

			<p>On top of that, in 2018, Facebook has encountered a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/23/17151916/facebook-cambridge-analytica-trump-diagram">major scandal with Cambridge Analytica</a>, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">political consulting firm based in the UK</a>. This political data-analysis firm had <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/01/10/business/trump-campaign-firm-cambridge-analytica-pleads-guilty-facebook-data-grab/">worked for the Trump campaign in 2016</a> and was accused for using the data of 50 million Facebook users without their permissions. The data was acquired by a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/guy-who-gave-cambridge-analytica-all-that-facebook-data-1826974109">third-party app known as ‘thisisyourdigitallife’</a> created by a researcher from Cambridge University. While downloading the app, Cambridge Analytica did not only access the data of the individuals only but for their friends also. This example only further exemplifies the occurrence of breaches in terms and conditions in our current age.</p>
			
			<p>The two events happened above in our timeline history had shown that the rights of a person in the digital world is closely related to whether if a person is willing to provide his/her own data to the organization. If the person agrees to provide its information to the organization, then the policies agreed between the company and the user must be uphold with local and international laws.</p>

			<p>For instance, if the data is not used in accordance with the framework laid down in the data protection laws then the part handling the dat ais to be held accountable for the misuse. The reason is because it is the user's responsiblity to provide the data to only a trusted company, and when it is provided, the company should continously guard the user's personal sensitive information, hence it is said that the moral standing of the user is highly depends on the terms agreed upon the data transfer.</p>

			<p>In conclusion, it is said that there is no moral standing or rights when a person is consciously providing his/her data to a third-party, because it is both the user and the organization's responsibility to comply with the terms agreed between the two party. And the only moral rights that we have will be in accordance of the agreement set.</p>

			<p>Therefore, respecting others' privacy is important and an organization must be professional enough to acknowledge that before thinking about making any extra profit generated by selling confidential information to third parties and losing its users’ trust. In addition, doing so would violate the ethical code of corporate conduct in which the company is expected and should be transparent in their policies regarding data collection and abiding by the local and international laws.</p>
