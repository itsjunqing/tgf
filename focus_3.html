		<h1 class="mt-4">Focus Question 3</h1>
		<h5 class="mt-4">Do you have the moral standing to complain about encroachment on your privacy when you consciously give away your information to third party services?</h5>

		<div class="mt-4">
			<p><span class="font-italic">What does agreeing to the terms and conditions mean when using a website?</span>
			Most websites have their own terms and conditions where the user is agreeing to it without reading the fine print. It gives the website the right to retain customer information in their database but also more importantly it gives them the right to track usage through cookies in the web browser. Users give web-based services – and third parties the services contract with, about which users know nothing – the right to keep, analyze and sell their data. Increasingly often, too, people click away their right to go to court if anything goes wrong. When clicking on ‘I agree’ the users acknowledge that they can not sue the company in the case when the third party misuses their data. This includes the data input by the user like name, gender, phone number, address, etc. This is the data given voluntarily by the user and the user expects that it will not be misused.</p>

			<p>Example (AT&T Privacy Breach):<br>
			In 2015 AT&T, a major telecom provider in the US, was fined $25 million by the FCC for data security and privacy violation. Employees at AT&T call centers in Mexico, Colombia and the Philippines were found to have stolen the names and full or partial Social Security numbers of about 280,000 of the wireless carrier’s customers in the United States. The workers sold that information to third parties. This whole practice was done so that these phones could be unlocked and used freely bypassing the contract with AT&T. The penalty imposed by FCC was the largest ever in history for privacy violation. No hack occurred but rather was an insider threat-based data misuse which caused concerns amongst AT&T users as to how their sensitive data like social security number was being sold to people whom they did not give consent to. AT&T terminated the contract with that call centre after the fine and pledged to take user’s data more seriously.</p>
			
			<p>Another example is the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal.<br>
			Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal was a major scandal which occurred in 2018 after Cambridge Analytica, a political data-analysis firm working for Trump campaign in 2016 was accused for using the data of 50 million Facebook users without their permission. The data was acquired by a third party app known as ‘thisisyourdigitallife’ created by a researcher from Cambridge University.  While downloading the app, Cambridge analytica did not only access the data of the individuals only but for their friends also.</p>
			
			<p>Moral Standing<br>
			I believe that the data which a person shares online is his sole property and if it is not used in accordance with the framework laid down in the data protection laws then the party handling the data is to be held accountable for the misuse. The reason is that when a user gives data to any company he trusts that the company will zealously guard the user’s personal sensitive information in customer records. Respecting others' privacy is important and an organization must be professional enough to acknowledge that before thinking about making any extra profit generated by selling confidential information to third parties and losing it’s users’ trust. Doing so violates the ethical code of corporate conduct in which the company is expected to be transparent about their policies regarding data collection and abiding by the local and international laws.</p>
