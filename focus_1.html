		<h1 class="mt-4">Focus Question 1</h1>
		<h5 class="mt-4">What trade-offs are you making when using the cloud? Have you consciously evaluated these trade-offs? What is your justification?</h5>

		<div class="my-4">
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud computing</a> is the delivery of on-demand computing services -- from applications to storage and processing power -- typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis. Everything from storage, networking and processing power can be rented over on the cloud.</p>

			<p>When we are using the cloud, we are risking our data by putting it online. It gives more accessibility but at the cost of being vulnerable to hacking. This is the biggest trade-off when thinking of moving to the cloud. When a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)</a> attack takes place, the data on the cloud is inaccessible and downtiming can occur. </p>

			<p>If the data which you need to access is time sensitive to your customers then this downtiming can affect the users and cause distress to them.  The data is unavailable during the DDoS and unless you have a backup you are left with nothing but to wait till the service is back online.</p>
			
			<p>Even the best teams can suffer from downtiming and server outages from time to time. The best example to illustrate this is the event which occurred on May 20, 2015. On this particular day, Apple iCloud had a seven- hour outage that affected the email and other cloud services like iCloud, drives amongst others. Some cloud providers have improved on this by setting up multi-region servers so that if one location gets DDoSâ€™d then there is backup from where the data can be accessed (at least partially so).</p>
			
			<p>If the cloud is being used in a home then the cost is not worth the benefits of accessibility it provides since inside a home the data does not needed everywhere. Even though the cloud service providers use industry best security practices there are still concerns regarding the sensitive data as it can be stolen by hackers. If an organization has signed up for a cloud service and they are not totally satisfied with the service then they would want to move to some other cloud service provider but that is not very easy because clouds are not cross-compatible. </p>

			<p>Another issue when using the cloud is that other than downtiming the cloud can have technical issues which might not be resolvable by reading the FAQ and you might want immediate remedy for that but since the technical support is not available 24/7 you might have to wait even days to get a response from the team depending on the quality of customer support the provider is offering.</p>
			
			<p>Furthermore, among the disadvantages of cloud computing is that its network connection dependency. Despite the numerous advantages of cloud computing, if there is no internet, the individual cannot send or retrieve files from the cloud. </p>
			
			<p>Finally, the choice to use cloud services or not depends on the risk appetite of the user. If the user wants to sync his data everywhere and is comfortable with using third party services for personal data then moving to the cloud seems quite reasonable and for organizations it means they can then rent cloud services on a pay-as-you-go basis but at the significant risk of data theft.</p>
